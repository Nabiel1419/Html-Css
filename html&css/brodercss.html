                A) more efficient use of organization’s IP address space
                Æ Subnets may significantly vary in relative size (computer 
                room = 200 hosts, secretary = 4 hosts…) 
                Æconsider a 4 host network with mask 255.255.255.0: wastes 
                250 IP addresses!
                Ö B) allows route aggregation, thus reducing routing 
                information needed
                Î Needs further support by routing protocol 
                Öe.g. RIP1 doesn’t support VLSM
