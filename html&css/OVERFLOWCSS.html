Q3. Define a class with appropriate data members and member functions which opens an input and output 
file, checks each one for being open, and then reads name, age, salary of a person from the input file 
and stores the information in an object, increases the salary by a bonus of 10% and then writes the 
person object to the output file. It continues until the input stream is no longer good.
Q4.. Define a class with appropriate data members and member functions for testing all the error bits with 
member functions.
This example has a get_int function that tries to read an integer from file, and checks everything. The 
function has three reference-type parameters: an input stream to read from, a bool good_flag 
parameter, which will be set to true if a valid integer was read in, and an integer variable, in which the 
read-in value will be stored. It returns a bool value that is true if we should continue reading from the 
stream, and false if we should stop. Function main() calls get_int in the condition of a while loop which 
continues as long as get_int returns true. When get_int returns, if value_is_good is true, then datum 
contains an integer that was successfully read in. We print it, and then continue to the loop. When 
get_int returns false, we stop looping and terminate.
Inside get_int, we first attempt to read an integer. If the stream is good, the variable contains a valid 
value, and we can continue reading the stream. If eof was encountered, a valid variable value was not 
obtained, and it time to stop reading the input. Likewise, if there was a "hard I/O" error. Finally, if the 
input was invalid, a valid value was not obtained. The example follows a policy to skip the rest of the 
line is skipped, and we should continue trying to read the stream (unless we hit end of file while 
skipping the rest of the line). 
The pattern represented by this example is :

1. Study and compare different software process models and prepare comparison based analysis report on it. 
Also identify the suitable applications for the individual process model. 
2. Case Study: You are the technical lead in your company for a new product aimed at university research 
scientists: an electronic lab notebook (ELN). The marketing team has given you the following information. 
The scientists who will use the ELN traditionally record their experiments in paper notebooks, but 
increasingly they are looking for digital solutions which allow them to share their information with other 
scientists they are working with, such as Wikis and Dropbox, which make frequent functionality changes. 
A small amount of market research indicates that the scientists vary considerably in what the capabilities 
they would like in an ELN, and the ELN solution will need to change over time as the scientists’ needs 
change. However the scientists all say an ELN should be easy to use and quick to use. The scientists work 
in labs headed by a senior academic (the Lab Head). Provision of computing resources for the lab 
(hardware and software) varies between labs. Some have all their needs met by the central university IT 
department; others manage all their own hardware and software and depend on central IT only for network 
connections; most are somewhere in between. 
a. Which software development process is likely to be most appropriate for developing the 
software system? 
b. Explain why, contrasting your choice with one other software development process.

Week 13.
1. You have just been hired as the web programmer for a new startup company 
called, WebPro. WebPro wants to sell books about web programming on the web (makes sense, 
doesn't it). They have asked you to design their web site using PHP and MySQL. They want the 
following abilities:
 browse inventory by category
 search inventory by author and title
 purchase multiple books; this includes the ability to
o add books to shopping cart
o view books in shopping cart
o delete books in shopping cart
o purchase books with credit card (only XCard is being accepted at this time)
Note: Because WebPro is a startup, they have a limited inventory.
You have decided to build the WebPro website incrementally.

Laboratory Experiments to be carried out by students.
Required: Python and/or MATLAB, scikit Learn
LAB1&2: Implement a Decision Tree (use IRIS dataset) for classification tasks. Use cross-entropy as a 
quality-criterion
a. What is an appropriate stopping criterion?
b. Give the probability (histogram) at each decision step (for each class).
c. Plot the cross entropy of each attribute (at each decision step).
d. What is the Information gain at each new node created?
e. Display the complete tree (use breadth first approach).
f. Use post-pruning approach to restrict the decision tree complexity (split dataset: 34% for train, 33% 
for validation, and 33% testing). That is, show, for each pruning decision, the gain at the parent node 
and collective gain of the children. How does the gain of post-pruning compare with that of part d?
LAB3&4: Implement and visualize KNN, using a dataset (IRIS or some other dataset). Describe the effects 
of various parameters of KNN algorithms on the performance.
a. How do different data splitting’s effect the performance (say: 70% Train, 30% Test vs others)?
b. How do various distance measures perform (Manhattan, Euclidean etc.)
c. Write a function to predict the class for a given input value.
d. How does the value of K affect the performance and how doe we choose and optimal value of K?
LAB5: Implement and visualize K-means, using a dataset (faithful dataset or some other dataset). Describe 
the effects of various parameters of K-means algorithms on the performance.
LAB6: Build a support vector machine (SVM) for classification, say spam. Use a dataset (one which is libsvm 
format) with scikit for classification. How does svm compare with a previous modal (use on Decision tree or 
KNN or KMEANS)?
LAB7&8: Use scikit Learn to compare LDA and PCA for Iris dataset.
a. Plot the sample of first two principal components (that is the direction for most variance in the dataset).
b. For LDA, which are the attributes that account for most variance in the dataset?
c. How does LDA and PCA help in dimensionality reduction(for the dataset in use)?
d. Implement Fischer’s LDA from scratch.
e. Implement a classification function for the LDA (that for a given input sample for the dataset it should 
identify its class).
LAB9: Use some dataset(handwritten digits) and show how a Random Forest can be used as a classifier.
LAB10&11: Naïve Bayes (implement from scratch for some dataset)
a. How does the algorithm work?
b. What are the variations to Naïve Bayes?
c. What are the pros and cons of using the algorithm?
d. What are the steps required to implement a basic Naïve Bayes?
e. How can we improve the Naïve Bayes?
f. When should we use Naïve Bayes?
Lab 12&13: Implement a GMM clustering
a. What is the weakness in K-means that motivates us to use GMM?
b. For some given dataset (where clusters are near to each other) visualize how K-means vs GMM, 
perform clustering.
c. Implement an Expectation Maximizing algorithm.
d. Implement a prediction function, which returns the class/cluster to which an input sample belongs.
e. Show how GMM can be used to estimate the probability distribution of a dataset.
